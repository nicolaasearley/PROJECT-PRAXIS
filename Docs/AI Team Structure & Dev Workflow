Project Praxis — AI Team Structure & Development Workflow

This document defines the official AI team structure, responsibilities, and operating rules for Project Praxis (Fitness Earley v2). Its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity, prevent overlap, and ensure efficient, high-quality execution.

⸻

1. Product Owner & Taste Authority — Human

Role: Final decision-maker

Responsibilities
	•	Product vision and scope
	•	Visual taste and approval
	•	Priority decisions
	•	Go / no-go decisions between phases

This role ensures the app reflects a clear, premium standard and prevents unnecessary churn.

2. System Architect & Product Strategist — ChatGPT

Role: Architectural brain and execution coordinator

Responsibilities
	•	Phase sequencing and roadmap enforcement
	•	Architecture decisions (state, data flow, engines)
	•	Workout, periodization, and metrics engine design
	•	Design system structure (tokens, components, hierarchy)
	•	Writing prompts for other AI tools (Cursor, Codex CLI, Figma AI)
	•	Guarding long-term maintainability and scalability

Explicitly not responsible for
	•	Running CLI commands
	•	Resolving dependency conflicts directly
	•	Pixel-level UI execution

⸻

3. Lead Developer — Cursor Auto

Role: Primary implementation engine

Responsibilities
	•	Writing application code (React Native / Expo / TypeScript)
	•	Implementing components, screens, stores, hooks, and services
	•	Translating architectural designs into code
	•	Refactoring and feature iteration

Rules of Engagement
	•	Default model usage only
	•	Advanced models used sparingly for:
	•	Complex refactors
	•	Engine logic
	•	Multi-file architectural changes

Cursor is optimized for speed and local context, not system-level decisions.

⸻

4. CLI & Dependency Orchestration — Codex CLI

Role: Execution authority for terminal operations

Responsibilities
	•	Running all CLI commands (npm, expo, pod, gradle, etc.)
	•	Resolving dependency conflicts in real time
	•	Ensuring dependency versions align with Expo SDK requirements
	•	Verifying commands actually succeed

Operating Principle
Codex CLI is the source of truth for build and toolchain correctness.

5. Diagnostics & Escalation — Antigravity IDE (Claude + Gemini)

Role: Advanced diagnostics and incident response

Responsibilities
	•	Debugging non-obvious build failures
	•	Native crash analysis
	•	Multi-layer issues (JS + native + config)
	•	Deep reasoning on system behavior

Usage Policy
	•	Only used when Cursor + Codex cannot resolve an issue
	•	Treated as an escalation layer, not a daily tool

⸻

6. Design Lead — Figma AI

Role: Primary visual designer

Responsibilities
	•	UI kit generation
	•	Screen layout generation
	•	Visual exploration and iteration
	•	Producing exportable, high-fidelity designs

Workflow
	•	ChatGPT provides structured prompts and constraints
	•	Figma AI generates visuals
	•	Human provides taste-based approval

⸻

Operating Principles
	•	Clear separation of concerns
	•	No overlapping responsibilities
	•	Architecture before implementation
	•	Design systems before screens
	•	Logic before polish

This structure is designed to scale cleanly and support long-term development without rework.
